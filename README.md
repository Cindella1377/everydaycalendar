An HTML5 rendition of Simone Giertz's Every Day Calendar gadget.

Simone Giertz, a YouTube celebrity famous for her hilarious robotics inventions, has announced her first hardware product for sale â€” the "Every Day Calendar" that motivates you to keep the momentum of any good habit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lpvy-xkSNA

Simone is running a Kickstarter campaign at https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simonegiertz/the-every-day-calendar and plans to ship the bamboo-framed gadget in May 2019.

In case you aren't a perennial procrastinator and wish to develop a habit before May 2019, this HTML5 rendition of Every Day Calendar serves as a virtual substitute. It stores all your achievements in your browser without sending anything to the server.

Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with Simone Giertz's Every Day Calendar project. I built this site out of admiration for her engineering ideas.
